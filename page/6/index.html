It has been announced that a WWE Saturday Night’s Main Event will air as a one hour special at 9:00 p.m. on Saturday, August 2 on NBC. The last time they taped Saturday Night’s Main Event, it was before the previous edition of Raw, so more than likely, the one-hour special will be taped before the live Raw show on July 28, 2008, which is taking place at the Verizon Center in our Nation’s Capital, Washington D.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>James Gunn confirms Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 will avoid the MCUs most tired trope</h2><time>Sep 5, 2024</time>

Marvel Studios likes to promote each of its movies and TV shows as possessing a unique flavor, and to some extent, that is true. But it’s also fair to say that most MCU projects follow the same template. A villain rises up, threatens the world and/or the universe, and the hero defeats them. Rinse and repeat. As we head into Phase Five, it seems folks are starting to tire of this formula, however, so it’s intriguing to hear that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Nicolas Cage Goes Bald In First Image From Gritty New Western</h2><time>Sep 5, 2024</time>
<a href=../../nicolas-cage-goes-bald-in-first-image-from-gritty-new-western.html></a>
Nicolas Cage has sported many questionable hairstyles and unconvincing wigs throughout his illustrious career, ranging from Valley Girl‘s bouffant to Ghost Rider‘s blatantly obvious hairpiece via Con Air‘s long, luxurious locks and whatever the hell he’s got on his head in 1993’s Deadfall.
Recommended Videos However, one thing we’ve never seen from the Academy Award winner is a completely bald head, but that’s all about to change. Cage is currently shooting gritty Western Butcher’s Crossing in the wilds of Montana, and Variety have revealed the first look at the one of the internet’s favorite actors in character, which you can see below.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>20,000 Days on Earth movie review (2014)</h2><time>Sep 4, 2024</time>
<a href=../../20000-days-on-earth-2014.html></a>
Assuming that a conventional documentary about Australian musician Nick Cave would be unrewarding, the makers of "20,000 Days on Earth" wisely fed their mercurial subject's ego by allowing him to walk them through a semi-fictionalized account of a typical day in his life. Having previously directed some music videos for Cave's band The Bad Seeds, "20,000 Days on Earth" co-directors Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard know not to underestimate Cave. In his music, he routinely celebrates/deconstructs his public persona: brutalizer, coward, agnostic, and wannabe deity.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>A hard-boiled thriller ripped out of the directors hands by its star and rewarded with a superior</h2><time>Sep 4, 2024</time>

As South Park famously put it; say what you want about Mel Gibson, but the son of a bitch knows story structure. Long before being lampooned by the animated classic, the two-time Academy Award winner put that to the test by getting too hands on for some in 1999’s hard-boiled thriller Payback.
Recommended Videos The theatrical version was a decent-sized hit that hauled in $162 million at the box office, but the behind the scenes issues ended up stealing away plenty of the spotlight.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>All Warhammer Darktide classes, explained</h2><time>Sep 4, 2024</time>

In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war. Recommended Videos The newest addition to the Warhammer 40K pantheon of video games has arrived. Developed by Fatshark Games, Warhammer 40K: Darktide, a first-person co-op shooter, sees players face off against an army of chaos-worshiping soldiers of the Moebian sixth. The traitorous regiment will attack the players in droves, and the gameplay is very similar to the Warhammer: Vermintide games.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Daniel Espinosa movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</h2><time>Sep 3, 2024</time>
