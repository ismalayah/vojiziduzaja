In 2022, someone posted on Reddit they remembered action star Vin Diesel coming out as gay, referring to the memory as a “Mandela Effect,” or a strong memory that turns out not to be true — so what’s the truth about Diesel’s sexuality?

Caroline and Kelly themselves are similarly well-scrubbed. Line is very lively but wholesome; her mischievous streak is never malicious but aims to push her friends to do things they might never have tried. As when she pushed Kelly to invite a handsome new neighbor to the season kickoff party at the dust-free barn Line’s dad owns, or when she impulsively challenges her teammates to partake in a pizza-eating contest, which move doesn’t sit well with her no-nonsense volleyball coach, Kathy Bresnahan, played by Helen Hunt.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Where is Lawmen: Bass Reeves streaming, and when do new episodes release?</h2><time>Sep 18, 2024</time>
