Five Nights at Freddy’s (FNaF) is the hit horror video game franchise that leans into the inherent creepiness of animatronics. However, with a new movie upon us, the question remains: Did the filmmakers use computer-generated imagery to bring the haunted automata to life or create life-size robotic figures for the film? Recommended Videos ThePG-13 FNaF stars Josh Hutcherson as a reluctant security guard for a restaurant chain, Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza.

<a href=../../oceans-thirteen-2007.html></a>
The modern caper movie, such as Steven Soderbergh's "Ocean's Thirteen," dispenses with such tiresome exposition and contains mostly action and movie-star behavior. Only the characters know what the plan is, and we are expected to watch in gratitude and amazement as they disclose it out of their offscreen planning and plotting. Fair enough, if it's done with energy and style. If, however their plan involves elements that are preposterously impossible, I feel as if I'm watching one of Scrooge McDuck's schemes.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Who is Christina Koch?
