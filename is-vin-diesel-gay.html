I remember it as well.” So, is there a Mandela Effect at play?</p><p data-characters=165 data-current-count=484 data-injectable=true>With all that in mind, let’s look at what’s known about Mr. Diesel’s sexuality and get to the bottom of this Diesel-related Mandala Effect mystery.</p><p data-characters=216 data-current-count=216 data-injectable=false>(In case you’re not aware, so-called Mandela Effects are named after how some people collectively remember South African leader Nelson Mandela dying in prison in the `80s, when Mandela died a free man in 2013.)</p><h2 id=h-diesel-s-sexuality-rumors-explained data-injectable=false>Diesel’s sexuality rumors, explained</h2><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=534 data-injectable=true>Rumors that Vin Diesel is gay have been around for about as long as The Fast and the Furious star has been famous.
