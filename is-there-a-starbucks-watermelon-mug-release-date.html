Recommended Videos The official Starbucks website does have pages dedicated to the watermelon mug, one for the 12oz mug and another for a 24oz watermelon plastic cold cup. The larger plastic shows a pretty basic design with a red cup with a green straw, whereas the small mug doesn‚Äôt have a picture currently."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Coffee drinkers online are hoping to get the opportunity to buy the mug soon, but do we actually know anything about a potential release date?</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=332 data-current-count=332 data-injectable=false>The official Starbucks website does have pages dedicated to the watermelon mug, one for the 12oz mug and another for a 24oz watermelon plastic cold cup. The larger plastic shows a pretty basic design with a red cup with a green straw, whereas the small mug doesn‚Äôt have a picture currently. Neither are available to buy right now.</p><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=640 data-injectable=true>The mug in question is a cute little thing. It‚Äôs got a picture of a watermelon slice printed on it, the bottom half is green whilst the top half is red with black seeds. The red and green are separated by a white line. It‚Äôs aesthetically pleasing so it‚Äôs understandable why people would want their own.</p><h2 id=h-the-watermelon-mug-has-been-around-for-a-while data-injectable=false>The watermelon mug has been around for a while</h2><p data-characters=328 data-current-count=328 data-injectable=false>Whilst you can‚Äôt purchase the mug now, you could about eight months ago, it was released in the UK on May 5th as part of a Summer collection. The watermelon mug has actually already been released and you can find secondhand sellers on the likes of Amazon and eBay if you‚Äôre desperate for one of these cute little mugs.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=637 data-injectable=true>Of course, you may be inclined to wait and see if Starbucks brings the mug back, surely it‚Äôs just a matter of waiting for them to re-stock the popular item right? And besides, Summer isn‚Äôt too far off now, maybe the coffee chain will re-release the popular mug around the same time it did last year.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=350 data-current-count=350 data-injectable=false>Whilst that is a possibility, it‚Äôs not likely to happen now due to the controversy surrounding it. I mentioned at the start that this item has a complicated history and you may be wondering how a mug could possibly cause a controversy. After all, it‚Äôs just a mug right? Wrong. Buckle your seatbelts and let‚Äôs venture down this rabbit hole.</p><h2 id=h-the-controversy data-injectable=false>The controversy</h2><p data-characters=206 data-current-count=556 data-injectable=true>So if you haven‚Äôt heard, Starbucks is currently being subjected to a boycott from customers worldwide. The reason for this boycott is down to the company‚Äôs stance on the Israel-Palestine conflict.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=285 data-current-count=285 data-injectable=false>To give a brief summary, Starbucks Workers United, the union that represents Starbucks workers, sent out a social media post supporting Palestine. This prompted Starbucks (the actual company) to sue the union for trademark infringement claiming that the post had damaged company sales.</p><p data-characters=238 data-current-count=523 data-injectable=true>Most corporations and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">figures in the public eye would try to stay impartial</a> on world events like this, but Starbucks suing its own workers union for supporting Palestine is not a good look and many have since vowed to boycott the company.</p><h2 id=h-so-how-does-the-watermelon-mug-fit-into-all-this data-injectable=false>So how does the watermelon mug fit into all this?</h2><p data-characters=339 data-current-count=339 data-injectable=false>Since 1967 the watermelon has been a symbol of Palestinian solidarity, the colors used for the mug design are the same colors featured on the Palestinian flag. Due to social media confusion, people online have mistakenly assumed that the mug is new and that the company is trying to appease the boycotters by showing support for Palestine.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=639 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>The desperation is desperating.

It doesn‚Äôt look like the watermelon mug is back despite what everyone is saying online, the pictures being shared are from last year, before the conflict in the Middle East escalated.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=259 data-current-count=259 data-injectable=false>Spokesperson for Starbucks, Jaci Anderson <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed with Snopes</a> that the mug is from last Summer, but that the company does sometimes see stock being sold out of season. It‚Äôs likely that there was extra stock and so the items remained on sale out of season.</p><h2 id=h-will-the-mug-return data-injectable=false>Will the mug return?</h2><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=566 data-injectable=true>Considering the backlash the item has caused it doesn‚Äôt seem likely Starbucks will make the mistake of re-releasing the mug anytime soon, even in the Summer. Neither the larger cup nor the smaller mug are available on the website now and the picture for the mug doesn‚Äôt even appear on the page anymore.</p><p data-characters=172 data-current-count=172 data-injectable=false>If you ask me, it looks like the company is attempting to bury all evidence that it ever existed.
