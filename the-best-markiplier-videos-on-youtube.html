Yeah, they didn’t know what they were talking about. Just ask Mark Fischbach, better known by his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>YouTube</strong></a> name, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Markiplier</a></strong>.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=275 data-current-count=275 data-injectable=false>With over 33.5 million subscribers and 18 billion total views for all his uploads, Markiplier is one of the most recognizable names in the gaming community. The channel ranks inside the top 100 most popular on YouTube, and he reportedly is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">worth an ungodly $35 million</a>.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=577 data-current-count=852 data-injectable=true>The 34-year-old <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">uploaded his first video</a> a decade ago. An aspiring actor, he initially chose to focus on sketch comedy. Since his goal was to play all the characters in his skits, Mark combined his name with “multiplier” to create his famous moniker, “Markiplier.” It wasn’t until he changed his focus to independent and horror game playthroughs that he achieved his stardom. Since then, he has become one of the faces of YouTube’s vast gaming content, having appeared on nationally broadcast shows like Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Larry King NOW, and The Today Show.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=276 data-current-count=276 data-injectable=false>What makes the YouTube community so obsessed with Markiplier? It’s all built on his eccentric personality, playing video games, and getting laughs. On that note, let’s take a look at some of Mark’s most famous and best videos on his main channel, also called Markiplier.</p><h2 id=h-heave-ho-mega-episode-w-jack-bob-wade data-injectable=false><strong>“Heave Ho MEGA EPISODE w/ Jack, Bob, Wade”</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=576 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=410 data-current-count=410 data-injectable=true>Being a (mostly) gaming channel, let’s kick things off with one of the most entertaining gaming videos on the channel, the “Heave Ho MEGA EPISODE.” Mark frequently collaborates with his cohorts, Bob and Wade. When the three are together, it makes for seriously dumb fun. In this particular video, the gang is joined by fellow YouTuber Sean William McLoughlin, better known to fans as Jacksepticeye.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=543 data-current-count=543 data-injectable=true>Whenever Mark and the gang jump on a party game, the show’s star inevitably becomes Wade. For someone who makes a living playing games, he seems to be terrible at basically all of them, which is actually refreshing. Instead of some pro gamer gliding through at lightspeed, Wade represents the rest of us, and it’s hilarious. What makes it better is how Sean’s frustration grows until it’s clear that he is completely fed up with Wade’s mishaps. It also makes me wonder if Wade purposely sabotages the group for his own amusement.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>“WARNING: SCARIEST GAME IN YEARS: Five Nights at Freddy’s Part 1”</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=180 data-current-count=480 data-injectable=true>“This is, like, the most terrifying game I’ve ever played,” Mark yelled in just minutes of playing Five Nights at Freddy’s. With that, the Markiplier empire was truly born.</p><p data-characters=330 data-current-count=330 data-injectable=false>Uploaded in 2014, Mark hopped into FNAF, a game that catapulted his popularity. As he points out in the video, his subscribers had urged him to give this one a try. Around that time, the original FNAF fame was an independent sensation. YouTubers all around were jumping on the bandwagon, and their audiences couldn’t get enough.</p><p data-characters=393 data-current-count=723 data-injectable=true>Of course, what Mark’s fans appreciated was the host’s take on the experience. As he played through the game, he overlaid it with his goofy faces and sometimes hilarious narration. It dialed back the horror and ramped up the comedy. Honestly, he’s only saying what we all are thinking with a game this stressful. It was his third-most popular upload ever, with 104,789,909 views to date.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>“MEOW”</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=329 data-current-count=629 data-injectable=true>Clearly, this is the video that helped usher Markiplier to the top of the YouTube charts. Considering he has made his mark mainly through gaming videos, it’s interesting that his most popular video is one of his most straightforward. It’s literally just him using cheap graphics to give cats his mouth and voice. That’s it.</p><p data-characters=317 data-current-count=317 data-injectable=false>It’s hard to believe that out of all Markiplier’s content, this is what has garnered over 363 million views since it was uploaded in 2015. It is by far his most-viewed video, with second place trailing well behind with 148 million, which is impressive in itself. Of course, it’s the dog version of “WOOF”.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=625 data-injectable=true>While “MEOW” may rank number one in popularity, this simple trick of Mark superimposing his mouth on cute animals to make them say mostly inappropriate things is hugely popular. As low-brow as it may be, three of his top-five videos fall in this category, combining for more than 609 million views.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=217 data-injectable=false>Is this his single best effort on his extensive channel? Not hardly, but who cares? If something this simple gets you over 350 million views, you’ve done something right, and it deserves its place on today’s list.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Larry King meets Markiplier</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=517 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=254 data-current-count=254 data-injectable=false>In this video with Larry King, Markiplier shares a bit more of a look into what made him the YouTuber he is, why charitable acts are so important to him, and why he believes authenticity is so important in his video content on the social media platform.</p><p data-characters=492 data-current-count=746 data-injectable=true>Markiplier does everything in a way that honors himself; he’s true to what he desires, he has a heart for others and often uses his platform to help them, and he loves to have fun with his friends. There’s not a lot that he isn’t transparent about, not a lot that he tries to hide. He is open about the length of time it took him to start bringing in money, he opens up about what he uses his money on, and he talks about fan interactions and how important they are to him.</p><p data-characters=365 data-current-count=365 data-injectable=false>This interview is a treat for any long-time fan of Markiplier, and if you’ve ever wanted to learn more about the YouTube star turned director and actor, this is the time to do it. The almost 20-minute video, as we said above, will ensure that your love for Markiplier only grows, and if you’ve yet to discover a true adoration for him, this will do it.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Boat Dog</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=665 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=373 data-injectable=false>For quite obvious reasons, this is actually a favorite of ours: the sweet under-15-second video simply titled Boat Dog. In the video, Markiplier narrates a day in the life of a boat dog, which is basically just him singing the words boat dog a few times in different pitches with editing done to make them sound a bit like a jingle to a song we’d really love to hear.</p><p data-characters=253 data-current-count=626 data-injectable=true>Better than the tune is the fact that Markiplier is swimming under the raft that his dog is sitting on and pushing it forward; if you pay close attention, you can see the entire thing as it unfolds. Is this a piece of cinematic gold? We sure think so.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Baldi’s basics in Nightmares</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=250 data-current-count=550 data-injectable=true>Does Baldi terrify anyone else? …Just us? Okay. Watching Markiplier play Baldi is certainly an interesting experience; within the first few seconds, he already sees his power fading quickly, and he’s not even figured out the basic rules yet.</p><p data-characters=547 data-current-count=547 data-injectable=true>Of course, a gamer with Markiplier’s experience doesn’t take long to figure it out, but as he attempts to, he’s left feeling quite flabbergasted. Is it pulling out old memories from scary school days? He has a hard time trying to fathom this game, and he does note that the game is built as a bit of a joke, but it’s just a little bit hard to wrap his mind around this version. Of course, he thinks the hiccups in the system are intentional, but it’s still something that he makes a valiant effort to try to work through.</p><p data-characters=380 data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false>As Markiplier goes through the rules again, he actually does manage to survive Baldi’s nightmare and survive for 3000 seconds, and he’s as shocked about it as we are. For some reason, watching Markiplier get a little frustrated while playing a game is a great watch, because we often feel this way when trying to play anything other than Mario Kart or Crash Bandicoot!</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>“GTA 5 Funny Moments #1: LAUGHING TOO HARD!!”</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=680 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=396 data-injectable=false>One of the best parts about Markiplier’s multiplayer videos is that he seems to include all of us. Whether you’re in the same room, or connected through a server, Mark and his YouTuber cohorts do all the ridiculous things that any of us do when we’re wasting time with our friends. Throw Grand Theft Auto V’s open-world shenanigans into the mix, and this is a highly entertaining video.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=398 data-current-count=794 data-injectable=true>The game is made to be as insane as you want it to be. Even though it’s approaching its 10th birthday, GTA V’s lush scenery and over-the-top cars and weapons beg you to break the law in a hilarious fashion. That’s exactly what Mark and his squad do. Watching them obsessively try to steal a fighter jet from the Los Santos military base will have you reaching for your copy of the game.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>“Bob’s Fridge”</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=211 data-current-count=511 data-injectable=true>Mark’s quote sums up what you’re getting into with this video: “They delivered a fridge so violently your house thought it was an earthquake?” To which Bob replied, “Yes, and this was the good team.”</p><p data-characters=444 data-current-count=444 data-injectable=true>When you have millions of followers, naturally, you expand into new territory. Thus, Mark added a podcast to his list of projects. I can’t say I’ve listened to a lot of Distractible, but this one got my attention. Mark, Bob, and Wade had a competition to see who could tell the funniest (I’m assuming true) story. Bob won this round hands down with a tale of mounting anger and probably the most inept delivery teams in the country.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=490 data-current-count=490 data-injectable=true>You almost have to be well into adulthood to fully appreciate his tale of Lowe’s woe. Using his YouTube bucks to buy a new refrigerator, Bob gets taken on a wild and frustrating ride through the world of appliance delivery. He goes through two delivery teams, a water leak, and enough suppressed rage to cause a tsunami. It’s Bob’s enthusiastic storytelling that makes it all so amusing. That and the fact that it actually happened the day Mark recorded that particular podcast.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>WADE LITERALLY EXPLODES IN RAGE | UNO</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=313 data-current-count=613 data-injectable=true>If you were to ask Markiplier fans which videos they love best, some of the responses would certainly be the ones that pertain to our favorite YouTuber as he plays various games with his friends. One of the best games the pals play together is Uno because, let’s get serious, we all take Uno very seriously.</p><p data-characters=360 data-current-count=360 data-injectable=false>So seriously, in fact, that at times, the card game can cause us to rage, and we’re not the only ones. Markiplier and his friends feel the depth of rage gaming at its finest across various rounds of Uno, and in the video we shared above, it’s Wade who is raging this time around. Call us easy to please, but we could watch them play games all day.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>“THE MI LITERALLY THROW A CHAIR IN RAGE | Getting Over It – Part 1”</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=660 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=481 data-current-count=481 data-injectable=true>To be completely honest, I didn’t understand what the Markiplier fuss was all about prior to watching this video. Admittedly, I am not a YouTube devotee; I mostly leave that to the younger generation. My teenage children absolutely loved this guy’s content, and they watched it religiously. One afternoon, I heard incessant screams, cursing, and shouting, which got my attention for the wrong reasons. Then I saw this game, and I completely understood where he was coming from.</p><p data-characters=326 data-current-count=326 data-injectable=false>Getting Over It with Bennett Fody is intentionally made to be insanely frustrating. Here you have I assume, Bennett in a cast iron pot with some sort of pickaxe/sledgehammer. As the player, you make little bald Bennett (with his superhuman upper-body strength) fling himself up a mountain one frustrating step at a time.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=594 data-current-count=920 data-injectable=true>Sounds simple enough, right? Wrong. All it takes is one infinitesimal false move, and Bennett tumbles down the mountain, sometimes all the way to the starting position. To antagonize the players, the developers added a voiceover that consoles you with words of wisdom about losing. Believe me, you will lose at this game, and that voice keeps giving you unwanted quotes again and again and again. By the 200th time, it’s clear those little nuggets aren’t meant to be consoling at all; it’s browbeating, and it’s hilarious… so long as it happens to someone else. Enter: Markiplier.</p><p data-characters=399 data-current-count=399 data-injectable=false>Over eight videos, Mark is all of us. Just as he is making progress, he miscalculates a climb, and down the mountain he goes. With each fall, Mark gets increasingly annoyed. Soon, that annoyance ferments into anger before transforming into full rage. And there are eight videos of Mark absolutely losing his mind. He screams, throws his chair, and he seems on the verge of a nervous breakdown.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=695 data-injectable=true>Up to that point, I hadn’t been interested in Markiplier. Watching him fling his chair at the wall over a video game reminded me of so many frustrating hours of tiny, stupid jumps over winged turtles in Super Mario Bros. 3. As I said, it’s great content when it’s happening to someone else.</p><p data-characters=136 data-current-count=136 data-injectable=false>So there you have it, some of Markiplier’s best videos ever, based on how much we enjoy them and the views they’ve received.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeppMK1wcGeZq2glWKvpr%2FTZqSaqpueva21xKtkr6GUmry0ec6nZLKnpanCo7GO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./saharan-dust-tracker-2021-today-live-map-shows-south-florida-will-be-hit-by-storm-cloud-that-will-turn-skies-orange.html><span>←</span><span>Saharan dust tracker 2021 today LIVE Map shows South Florida will be hit by storm cloud that 'wi</span></a>
