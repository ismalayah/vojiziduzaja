Mrs Richards locked in.</p><p data-characters=361 data-current-count=361 data-injectable=false>No one can argue Pascal and Kirby aren’t tremendous talents in of themselves, but what some folks are wondering is whether the pair would have strong enough romantic chemistry to play the mom and dad of Marvel’s First Family. A big part of this apprehension seems to stem from the actors’ significant age difference. But how old are they both?</p><h2 id=h-how-old-is-pedro-pascal-and-how-old-is-vanessa-kirby data-injectable=false>How old is Pedro Pascal and how old is Vanessa Kirby?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fantastic-four-1.png><p data-characters=488 data-current-count=488 data-injectable=true>At the time of writing, The Mandalorian and The Last of Us icon Pedro Pascal is 48 years old. If he does indeed become Reed Richards, the fourth actor to bring the character to life in the 21st century, he will be <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the oldest to have that honor</a>, beating Doctor Strange 2‘s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">John Krasinski by a handful of years</a>. Meanwhile, Vanessa Kirby — recently seen opposite Marvel’s own Hayley Atwell and Pom Klementieff in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning — is 35 years old.</p><p data-characters=452 data-current-count=452 data-injectable=true>That means the two actors have an age difference of 13 years. That would give them one of the largest age gaps between a Marvel couple, but they would still have nothing on Paul Bettany (52) and Elizabeth Olsen (34). The WandaVision stars have an 18-year age difference, and yet Scarlet Witch and Vision are one of the most beloved of all the MCU’s romances. Clearly, age is just a number then and if Pascal and Kirby have it, then they have it.</p><p data-characters=144 data-current-count=144 data-injectable=false>Whether they do have it — the job, I mean — remains to be seen, though. Fantastic Four is coming to theaters on Valentine’s Day 2025.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGZpGK2tHnToZxmmZeaeqW1xZ%2Bcq52emLJursStrp6dnmK9prDRqGSpmaOYrq15wKebZq6Ro7K0v8BmoqKqkq58</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tarik-cohen-injury-update-contract-salary-net-worth-height-age-40-time-instagram-2.html><span>←</span><span>Tarik Cohen Injury Update, Contract, Salary, Net Worth, Height, Age, 40 Time, Instagram</span></a>
