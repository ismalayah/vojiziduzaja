One has to imagine the golden wine goblets are not far behind.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=431 data-current-count=431 data-injectable=true>Fans first began noticing the gold wine glasses during the first season of the popular reality dating series, as every cast member seemed to drink exclusively from the distinct-looking chalices throughout their time in the pods, trips to Mexico, apartments, weddings, and even during family visits. And they drank not just wine and other alcoholic beverages out of the goblets, but coffee, tea, water, soft drinks — you name it.</p><p data-characters=144 data-current-count=144 data-injectable=false>In fact, many fans have taken to Twitter to speculate what the so-called love affair is between the gold glasses and producers of Love is Blind.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=444 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Can someone please explain to me why all the wine/drink glasses everywhere in Love is Blind are opaque metal</p><p>This bothers me more than it should <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Zhti93PAeR</a></p>— Paul Tassi (@PaulTassi) <a href=#>February 20, 2022</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Why are these wine glasses showing up at other peoples homes?

Shortly after the premiere of season 2, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a> spoke with Love is Blind series creator creator Chris Coelen, who attributed the reason to branding and aesthetics.</p><p>“I don’t know. It’s something I like. When you turn on the show, you know it’s our show. It’s a very authentic, really true following of these people’s journeys, but I like the fact that we have this sort of connective tissue with that in a really light way, it’s fun.”</p><p data-characters=263 data-current-count=263 data-injectable=false>Though, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Today show blog</a> alludes to an even more basic explanation — continuity. “Since the glasses are opaque, the show’s editors can splice together scenes without worrying about how much liquid is left in the cup,” the publication notes.</p><p data-characters=224 data-current-count=487 data-injectable=true>In either case, the goblets have made their mark on not just fans of the show, but the stars themselves. Back in February, the ladies of season 2 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke with E! News</a> and revealed plans of getting matching wine goblet tattoos.</p><p>“All the girls, we wanted to get like a tiny little goblet tattooed on ourselves,” Deepti Vempati shared with E! News. Fellow contestant Shaina Hurley added, “We still have to do that.”</p><p>And as fans of the show have noticed, the cast drinks everything (and we mean everything) out of the gold glasses. “We’ve been through so much,” Deepti continued. “And we would always put all of our drinks in the gold goblets. It’s just a symbolic thing for us.”</p><p data-characters=124 data-current-count=124 data-injectable=false>Fans can break out their finest metallic gold drink ware when Love is Blind season 3 premieres on Netflix on Oct. 19, 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ytu9WeZKKrXZe5qrrDZp6opJRiuqbAwKVksKGemnqouMCsqp6rXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tawny-moyer-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Tawny Moyer Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</span></a>
