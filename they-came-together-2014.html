<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>They Came Together movie review (2014)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>It’s got all the moments and beats you’d expect—the meet-cute, the instant hatred that turns to flirtation, the perky montage of trying on clothes, the contrived misunderstanding that keeps the couple apart and finally—mercifully—the mad dash to a wedding for some very public, last-minute I-love-yous. But simply recreating what we know to be hackneyed and safe doesn’t suddenly make it hilarious and surprising. There has to be a spin to it; there has to be some innovation.</p><p>Anyone who has seen a movie starring <a href=#>Julia Roberts</a>, <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a> or <a href=#>Kate Hudson</a> can recognize what’s going on and find a chuckle here and there. But mostly, the results are shockingly unfunny and sadly lifeless, especially given the wealth of comic talent involved.</p><p><a href=#>Paul Rudd</a> and <a href=#>Amy Poehler</a> star as the <a href=#>Tom Hanks</a>/<a href=#>Meg Ryan</a> types at the film’s center, recounting how they met and fell in love over dinner with an underused <a href=#>Bill Hader</a> and <a href=#>Ellie Kemper</a>. The latter couple is meant to serve as our stand-ins, trying to remain politely charmed by the increasingly inane details they’re hearing in extended flashbacks.</p><p>The core of the plot plays like a knowingly cutesy version of "You’ve Got Mail," but "They Came Together" also features recognizable rom-com nuggets ranging from "Pillow Talk" to "When Harry Met Sally..." Rudd’s Joel works for a giant, soulless candy corporation. Poehler’s Molly owns a neighborhood candy shop that’s "charming and adorable and impossible not to like," as she puts it. But wouldn’t you know? Joel’s company is trying to run Molly’s store out of business. Can their affection withstand such stress?</p><p>And so we watch as they show up for a Halloween party dressed in the same costume and immediately clash. (This is also where the film takes a painful, extended detour for a discussion of whether <a href=#>Christopher Meloni</a> soiled himself in his superhero outfit. Spoiler alert: He did.) We watch them fall for each other over books and coffee in an idyllic version of New York City—which is like a character itself in their relationship, we’re told repeatedly, when such a convention should be clear.</p><p>Throughout this familiar process, the jokes are either annoyingly repetitive or overly spelled out for us. It’s obvious what they’re parodying—the rom-com is an incredibly common type of clichéd film; its tropes are well-known and well-worn. Still, it’s not enough for Molly to be adorably klutzy; the dialogue has to inform us that she’s adorably klutzy in addition to showing her knocking over a bunch of her belongings in her bedroom before tumbling down a flight of stairs on the way to work.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn56xXZiurrGMraagnaSdsrN5kWlobQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-there-going-to-be-a-season-5-of-doom-patrol.html><span>←</span><span>Is there going to be a season 5 of Doom Patrol?</span></a>
