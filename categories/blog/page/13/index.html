<a href=../../../../donnie-darko-2001.html></a>
The movie is grounded solidly in a leafy suburban setting, where the neighbors gather behind police lines while a big flatbed truck hauls the engine away and the FBI questions the Darko family. There is much unexplained. For example, no airline is reporting that an engine is missing from one of its jets. Where did the engine come from? Donnie has no more idea than anyone else, and we follow him through high school days with an English teacher (Drew Barrymore) who is sympathetic, and a gym teacher who requires the class to locate imaginary experiences on a "</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Epic 3D billboard for The Super Mario Bros.

<a href=../../../../a-field-in-england-2013.html></a>
But the plot and theme aren't what you remember later; they aren't even what make an impression as you're watching "A Field in England." Written by Wheatley ("Down Terrace," "Kill List") and Amy Jump, and shot in mostly handheld black-and-white wide-screen images, this is a deeply, at times exclusively visceral film. It aims to wring out, mind-eff and visually beat up its viewers, and cast a malevolent spell in the process.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Ashley Tisdale Favorite Color Food Starbucks Drink Animal Movies Things Biography</h2><time>Aug 11, 2024</time>
