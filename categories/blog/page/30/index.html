With his latest film, “House of Darkness,” LaBute tries something similar to "The Wicker Man." And while the results may not be nearly as outlandish this time around, they do make for an intriguing and occasionally quite witty battle of the sexes, in which not all of the bloodshed is strictly metaphorical.
As the film opens, a car with a couple inside approaches a large house in the middle of nowhere.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>From The Avengers to Secret Invasion: Every Maria Hill Marvel appearance</h2><time>Jun 13, 2024</time>

Warning: The following article contains spoilers for the first episode of Secret Invasion. Please read at your own discretion.
Recommended Videos Secret Invasion is an infinitely curious stepping stone for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, especially after that atomic bomb of an opening episode. Putting aside the fact that the series is taking full advantage of Marvel’s tendency to play with tone in their Disney Plus shows, it’s already thrown some groundbreaking nuances into the MCU mythos after just one episode, and we can only imagine how they’ll escalate as more episodes release.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Mareep (Evolving Skies 54) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</h2><time>Jun 13, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../../richard-lewis-obituary.html></a>
Most people had no idea who Richard Lewis was back then. Sure, comedy fans knew he was on track to become one of the greats, and he was sort of breaking through, slowly, in his own way. But he could probably have walked down any big city street in America and not been noticed by anyone but people who watched a lot of late night talk shows (he was a regular on Johnny Carson and David Letterman) or saw his standup specials on cable (between 1988 and 1991, the years in which I slavishly impersonated Richard Lewis, he released three classics: I'm Exhausted, I'm Doomed, and Richard Lewis: The Magical Misery Tour).</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../../categories/blog/page/29/>← Prev Page</a>
