Who's the real bad guy here? That seems to be Russell's primary question. He also appears to have taken a side, especially considering the tone of and comparisons made by the movie's coda, in which we learn the fates of the real-life figures from this story. By the end of this movie, though, one likely will be asking: Why do we have to choose?
Ulbricht is played by Nick Robinson, and his character first appears in a pointless flash-forward to the very end of this story, surrounded by federal agents during a sting operation in a public library in San Francisco.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Danielle Hanratty</h2><time>Jun 26, 2024</time>

More like the J.J. Abrams-helmed “Star Wars” sequels than anything George Lucas made, “Kalki 2898 AD” takes place in a godless world with scarce resources, low birth rates, and no heroes except the self-interested. Supreme Yaskin (Kamal Haasan), a Palpatinian cyborg despot, rules the pseudo-Utopian Complex by proxy, through baby-faced Commander Manas (Saswata Chatterjee), an inexhaustible battalion of storm troopers, and a ton of amoral, bounty-seeking scavengers. Headlining star Prabhas plays one such scavenger, Bhairava, a happy-go-lucky mooch who owes money,&nbsp;I mean credits, all around town.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Paige Adams-Geller Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</h2><time>Jun 26, 2024</time>
