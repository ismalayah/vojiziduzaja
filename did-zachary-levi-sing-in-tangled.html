Over a decade after the film’s premiere, though, one question still remains in the minds of the audience. Flynn Rider sings in Tangled, but is it really Zachary Levi’s voice we hear?</p><h2 id=h-does-zachary-levi-sing-as-flynn-rider data-injectable=false>Does Zachary Levi sing as Flynn Rider?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=693 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=453 data-current-count=453 data-injectable=true>Believe it or not, Zachary Levi actually has some golden pipes. The actor fully committed to his role as Flynn Rider and his singing voice was put to good use in what has become one of the most iconic moments in Tangled — the duet between Rapunzel and Flynn. Accompanied by Mandy Moore, the voice actress for the princess, Levi delivers a heart-melting performance in “I See the Light,” with all the tenderness the moment and song require.</p><p data-characters=359 data-current-count=359 data-injectable=false>The song became so successful that the actor later performed it live at the 83rd Academy Awards ceremony; however, despite being wildly considered the best, this isn’t Levi’s only tune in the film. He also performs the fun “I’ve Got a Dream” in the first half of Tangled, along with Brad Garrett, Mandy Moore, and Jeffrey Tambor.</p><p data-characters=220 data-current-count=579 data-injectable=false>If Disney ever decides to green-light a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">live-action adaptation of Tangled</a>, fans likely won’t see Levi <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reprise his role as Flynn</a>, but hopefully, his musical talent will be put to use in some other way in the future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJom6KcXa%2BupLTAq7BmpJWrtm6%2FyKeeZqGeYsGiusalnJ1n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nikki-sixx-motley-crue-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Nikki Sixx of Mtley Cre Net Worth Richest Music Artists</span></a>
