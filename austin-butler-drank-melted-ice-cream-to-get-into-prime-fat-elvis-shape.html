The actor has revealed that, in order to gain weight to more closely resemble <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Elvis</a></strong> in the last stretch of his career and life, he added melted ice cream to his diet.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=292 data-current-count=292 data-injectable=false>Weight transformations are always admired in Hollywood, from both extremes. Luckily for Butler, when it actually came to shooting the film, he had a bodily adjustment suit and prosthetics to help out. “We don’t call them fat suits,” he quipped in conversation with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a>.</p><p data-characters=440 data-current-count=732 data-injectable=true>The ice cream, and “a dozen of doughnuts a day” came before all that, he revealed. He was advised by his agent to put on the weight in order to convince Elvis director Baz Luhrmann that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he could play a convincing older Presley</a>. Butler then took a page from Ryan Gosling’s book from when he was gearing up to play a perverted child predator in Peter Jackson’s The Lovely Bones, and started drinking melted ice cream.</p><p data-characters=255 data-current-count=255 data-injectable=false>Butler and Gosling’s stories had completely opposite endings, though, because the former successfully convinced Luhrmann to go with him for the role of Elvis, while the latter <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">shocked Jackson into firing him</a> from the part after gaining 60 pounds.</p><p data-characters=321 data-current-count=576 data-injectable=true>Production on Elvis was massively affected by the pandemic, which eventually led Butler to rent a place in Australia while he waited for the ball to get rolling. When shooting finally kicked off, none of it was done chronologically, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">so the Carrie Diaries actor couldn’t have put on the weight even if he wanted to</a>.</p><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=217 data-injectable=false>Still, the Golden Globe-winning actor probably didn’t want to keep the weight for more than a few weeks. He described the experience as “fun for a week or so, and then you feel awful about yourself.”</p><p data-characters=84 data-current-count=301 data-injectable=false>Elvis is nominated for eight Oscars.
