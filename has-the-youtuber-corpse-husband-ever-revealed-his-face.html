Most of his content sees Corpse pitting his video game skills against other creators and friends, but he hasn’t restricted himself to purely streaming uploads. The creator also dabbles in music — using his unusually deep voice <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">to his advantage</a> — and tells scary stories, once again leaning on the uniquely ominous vibes he can stir up via his husky baritone.</p><p data-characters=728 data-current-count=728 data-injectable=true>Numerous rumors have cropped up over the years claiming that Corpse was finally prepped to reveal his true face. These rumors even rose to viral status in late 2021 after a leak supposedly revealed <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Corpse’s true face</a>. The reaction to this supposed reveal was hugely polarizing after a number of users dragged the popular streamer for his “ugly” appearance despite their demands for an unveiling. The following days saw claims over Corpse’s supposed face come into question, after several different images — showing clearly different people — all claimed to be the real deal. Fans of Corpse also flamed naysayers, noting the “double standard” and dragging <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">rude posters</a> for their toxicity.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Y’all being so mean about the corpse face leak… he literally sings about how self conscious he is about his appearance and you guys are out here bashing him bc he doesn’t live up to your fantasies? Disgusting. Absolutely pathetic</p>— armchair (@ArmchairLivee) <a href=#>September 26, 2021</a></figure><p data-characters=575 data-current-count=875 data-injectable=true>Once the viral rumor was debunked as fake, Corpse found himself back at square one. Following the deeply negative response to the fake photos, however, far fewer fans are pushing the streamer to do a face reveal in acknowledgement of the inevitable hate it will likely prompt. As such, the popular YouTuber has yet to reveal his face to his 7.61 million subscribers. He’s shown small aspects of himself, like his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">body</a> and hands — and even a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">strand of hair</a> — via several Instagram posts, but it seems that the creator is entirely content to keep his face a mystery.</p><p data-characters=91 data-current-count=91 data-injectable=false>Following the internet’s reaction to his fake face reveal, it’s no wonder why.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1or%2BMrZ%2BeZamkwrXBwZ6pZpufp720sYyhrKyakaOxbrHVnqlmqpWrsqK4xJ1koaGjYrOir8Ro</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ebony-de-la-haye.html><span>←</span><span>Ebony De La Haye movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</span></a>
