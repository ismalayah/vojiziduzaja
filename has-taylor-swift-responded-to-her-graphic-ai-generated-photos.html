She has been taking some well-deserved rest by spending time in the romantic refrain of her new beau Travis Kelce, whether it be in the form of the cheering crowd in the latest Kansas City Chiefs game or the glamorous birthday parties that feature members of the star-studded Taylor Squad.</p><p data-characters=86 data-current-count=86 data-injectable=false>One begins to wonder, what could possibly go wrong? Well, the internet, for one thing.</p><p data-characters=321 data-current-count=407 data-injectable=true>Taylor Swift is apparently, and rather unsettlingly, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the latest victim of deepfake sexual harassment</a>. Many fans were appalled to find their favorite musician trending on X (formerly Twitter) because of a series of graphic, sexually explicit, AI-generated photos that showed her in a number of very distasteful scenarios.</p><p data-characters=323 data-current-count=323 data-injectable=false>The legions of Swifties quickly rose to the occasion and began a meticulous campaign on the social media platform, reporting pages that posted the AI images and taking over the feed with #ProtectTaylorSwift. That seems to have dulled the brunt edge of the controversy so far, but has Taylor herself commented on the matter?</p><h2 id=h-what-was-taylor-swift-s-response-to-the-explicit-ai-photos data-injectable=false>What was Taylor Swift’s response to the explicit AI photos?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/taylor-swift-eras-tour-apple.jpg><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=345 data-injectable=false>Taylor Swift or her representatives have yet to release a statement, but knowing the singer and her tendency to interact with her fans on social media, it’s safe to assume that she’s already well aware of the disturbing statement and thinking of the best way to respond to it. You know, like the “Mastermind” that she is.</p><p data-characters=386 data-current-count=731 data-injectable=true>It’s worth noting that Taylor is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">hardly the first person to have to deal with this over</a> the past couple of years. Celebrity deepfakes <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">have been steadily on the rise for a while</a>, and with the surge of general-purpose AI models like ChatGPT or image generators like Dall-E and Midjourney, it was only a matter of time before the myriad of ethical and legal dilemmas caught up to us.</p><p data-characters=394 data-current-count=394 data-injectable=false>That being said, this is definitely the first time we’ve seen such a forceful, explosive response to the issue. Taylor has been taking names and kicking butt across the music industry and even cinema lately, mostly using her influence to bring about positive changes, so it’s already making us wonder if AI is going to be the next item on the list. Heaven knows, the world needs it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1or%2BMrZiypJ%2BnerTDyJ%2BrZqqVqL2wusOem2asn2K1pr6MoKmaqJiesG6tyGaenqaVp661scNmp6GnpKTAcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cian-elyse-white-wikipedia-biography-age-height-boyfriend-instagram.html><span>←</span><span>Cian Elyse White Wikipedia, Biography, Age, Height, Boyfriend, Instagram</span></a>
