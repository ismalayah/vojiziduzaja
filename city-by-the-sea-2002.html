<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>City By The Sea movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2002)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The cop's story is intercut with the life of his son, Joey (<a href=#>James Franco</a>), a strung-out addict who has worked himself into a fearful situation involving debt and need. In a confusing struggle, he knifes a drug dealer, and eventually, inevitably, LaMarca is working the case and discovers that the killer may have been Joey.</p><p>If this story sounds a little too symmetrical and neat, and in a way it does, real life supplies a rebuttal: "City by the Sea" is based on a true story, as described by the writer Mike McAlary in a 1997 Esquire article. I learn from Variety, however, that in fact the murder the son committed was vicious and premeditated, and not, as it is here, more or less an accident.</p><p>The plot takes us places we have been before, right down to the scene where LaMarca resigns from the force and places his gun and badge on the captain's desk. There is also the possibility in LaMarca's mind that his son is innocent--he claims he is--and there is the enormous psychic burden caused by the fact that LaMarca's own father was convicted of a heartless murder. The last act of the movie is the sort of cat-and-mouse chase we have seen before, staged with expertise by director <a href=#>Michael Caton-Jones</a>, but the movie's heart isn't in the action but in the character of Vince LaMarca.</p><p>De Niro has worked so long and so frequently that there is sometimes the tendency to take him for granted. He is familiar. He has a range dictated by his face, voice and inescapable mannerisms, but he rarely goes on autopilot and he makes an effort to newly invent his characters. Here he is a man with a wounded boy inside. Most of the time the cop routine provides him with a template for behavior: He keeps his head low, he does his job well. But inside is the kid who found out his dad was a killer. That provides the twist when he finds himself on his own son's case. There is hurt here, and De Niro is too good an actor to reduce it to a plot gimmick. He feels it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46coK2xXZfGbsDHnmSsnZFif3F8kQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./doug-winkler-death-obituary-egg-harbor-township-high-school-teacher.html><span>←</span><span>Doug Winkler Death, Obituary, Egg Harbor Township High School Teacher</span></a>
