As Reynolds announces in his Gin promotion, fans will have a chance to win a trip to the most excellent game on earth. As everyone knows by now, the actor has been busy co-owning the Wrexham football team and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fanatically supporting them throughout the season</a>. His head is in a whole different space as he watches his football team kick a ball around a rectangular field. That‚Äôs a totally different type of football game that will be played today in the State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.</p><p data-characters=253 data-current-count=253 data-injectable=false>So, what does Reynolds have to do with the NFL? That‚Äôs the thing. In his most charming way, he talks about the ‚Äúother football‚Äù while promoting the Super Bowl and his own brand of Gin. That‚Äôs just good marketing and good timing.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=553 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Whole Super Bowls were won in less time. <a href=#>https://t.co/tDEUPjoYnt</a> <a href=#>@nfl</a> <a href=#>@AviationGin</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/B42RLGPZIc</a></p>‚Äî Ryan Reynolds (@VancityReynolds) <a href=#>February 12, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=292 data-current-count=292 data-injectable=false>Tom Brady wasn‚Äôt the only one but was notorious for teaching fans of the NFL that anything can happen in a minute. It only takes a few seconds to score a touchdown and break the heart of the other team. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs the GOAT. But Reynolds is giving everyone two minutes.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>You can get so much done in a single ginute, two is like an eternity.</p>‚Äî Maximum Effort (@MaximumEffort) <a href=#>February 12, 2023</a><p data-characters=113 data-current-count=405 data-injectable=true>If anyone played football, they know what the two-minute drill is.

It‚Äôs an opportunity and fans should be jumping on it on both occasions that were mentioned in the promo.
