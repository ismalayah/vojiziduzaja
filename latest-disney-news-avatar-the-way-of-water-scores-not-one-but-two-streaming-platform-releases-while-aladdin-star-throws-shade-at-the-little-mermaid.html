You know, the film Disney decided wasn’t worth promoting.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-sharing-is-caring-as-avatar-the-way-of-water-is-awarded-two-streaming-platform-premieres-with-disney-and-hbo data-injectable=false>Sharing is caring as Avatar: The Way of Water is awarded two streaming platform premieres with Disney and HBO</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/avatar-the-way-of-water-payakan.jpg><p data-characters=537 data-current-count=537 data-injectable=true>After 142 days of waiting, Disney finally announced that all three hours and 12 minutes of Avatar: The Way of Water will premiere on Disney Plus beginning June 7. The studio promised extra bonus content to come with the highly-anticipated debut but threw moviegoers a curveball by also announcing that the film will be <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">duly available on both Disney Plus and (HBO) Max</a>. For a film that was in theaters for nearly three months, it only makes sense that it’d be on two streaming platforms. It doesn’t make it any less confusing, though.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Aladdin star throws shade at The Little Mermaid and wastes no time in deleting his Twitter account</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Mena-Massoud-as-Aladdin-in-Aladdin.jpg><p data-characters=628 data-current-count=928 data-injectable=true>Mena Massoud probably didn’t realize he was poking the proverbial bear when he commented on The Hollywood Handle’s Twitter post, but that’s exactly what happened after the 31-year-old actor declared that Rob Marshall’s The Little Mermaid <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wouldn’t cross the billion-dollar threshold</a> despite positive open weekend predictions. The move was somewhat unprecedented for Massoud, who hasn’t built a reputation for being snarky or inconsiderate online, but instead of seeking to understand his intentions, the internet turned on him. As such, he promptly fled the platform, taking his active Twitter account with him.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Crater defies its rotten critical reception by being properly “depressing,” and fans love it</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Disney-Plus-Crater-.png><p data-characters=578 data-current-count=878 data-injectable=true><a href=#>As mentioned last week</a>, Disney pulled the rug out from under us when it dropped Crater on Disney Plus with virtually no warning. Only a handful of marketing posts exist on its social media platforms, meaning the film entered the weekend with zero fanfare, save the fanfare of no fanfare (make sense of that). Somehow, it still <a href=#>entered the streaming Top 10</a>, with more than a few people commenting on how <a href=#>pleasantly “depressing” it is</a> (make sense of that). The film currently has a 53 percent Rotten Tomatoes score but is sitting semi-pretty with a 61 percent audience score.</p><p data-characters=411 data-current-count=411 data-injectable=false>Because we refuse to leave you with anything other than good news today (consider it turning a new leaf), here’s a touching performance of Halle Bailey <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">singing “Part of Your World”</a> at Disneyland as part of her promotional tour for The Little Mermaid. May that hold you over until tomorrow, at which point we will return with more news, although we can’t promise it’ll all be good.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoo5qslajBbrDIrKWesV2jsri%2FjJqtmqyRp3q1tMRmrpqxXaSzbsPArZyrZaOYvLOx0malqKxdpLumecGuq2asp6R6tMDRnpimoZ6cerG4wK2dqKqdYr%2BmuMSaqp6rXay1qrjEZpilmZSZtq950q2Yq2Wknb%2Bww9JmqqGZlJp6osCMrZ%2BeZZyewbW4xGaknqqdlralew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-christina-koch-nasas-artemis-ii-crew-members-net-worth-age-husband-robert-koch-career-family-and-more.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Christina Koch?
