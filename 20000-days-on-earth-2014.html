Having previously directed some music videos for Cave's band The Bad Seeds, "20,000 Days on Earth" co-directors <a href=#>Iain Forsyth</a> and <a href=#>Jane Pollard</a> know not to underestimate Cave. In his music, he routinely celebrates/deconstructs his public persona: brutalizer, coward, agnostic, and wannabe deity. "20,000 Days on Earth" is accordingly not a biography, but a portrait of the artist as a work-in-constant-progress.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v45rZ2loYGKxosXSZqanZZWWv7W0jGtnamw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nicolas-cage-goes-bald-in-first-image-from-gritty-new-western.html><span>←</span><span>Nicolas Cage Goes Bald In First Image From Gritty New Western</span></a>
