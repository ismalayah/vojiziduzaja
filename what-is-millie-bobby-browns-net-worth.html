However, this number will likely quickly rise as her fame grows and she makes her presence felt on new projects.&nbsp;This is doubly true if her upcoming films do well at the box office. In the past, Brown, along with her fellow younger cast mates from Stranger Things, all made $30,000 per episode in the show’s first two seasons. From there, the cast was given a pay increase due to the series’ overwhelming popularity, with Brown making close to $2 million per season now.</p><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=308 data-injectable=false>This success will likely lead to Brown becoming a hot property in Hollywood, leading to her making even more money for both her acting roles and her future modeling appearances.&nbsp;So, it’s clear that her millions show no signs of slowing down, and if anything, her net worth is only set to increase.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZZ2eua21xGaZqJqSrnqjvs6wpaxlnprBbsPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./blacklist-review-leonard-caul-season-2-episode-19.html><span>←</span><span>The Blacklist Review: Leonard Caul (Season 2, Episode 19)</span></a>
