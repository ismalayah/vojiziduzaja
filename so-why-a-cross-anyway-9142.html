India, Syria, Persia and Egypt have all yielded numberless examples .*.*. The use of the cross as a religious symbol in pre-Christian times and among non-Christian peoples may probably be regarded as almost universal, and in very many cases it was connected with some form of nature worship.”—Encyclopædia Britannica (1946), Vol. 6, p. 753.</p><p>“Various figures of crosses are found everywhere on Egyptian monuments and tombs, and are considered by many authorities as symbolical either of the phallus [a representation of the male sex organ] or of coition. .*.*. In Egyptian tombs the crux ansata [cross with a circle or handle on top] is found side by side with the phallus.”—A Short History of Sex-Worship (London, 1940), H. Cutner, pp. 16,*17; see also The Non-Christian Cross, p.*183.</p><p>And I agree with what GrnMrvl13 posted. I was going to ask similar questions: How would you feel if one of your dearest friends was executed on the basis of false charges? Would you make a replica of the instrument of execution?
