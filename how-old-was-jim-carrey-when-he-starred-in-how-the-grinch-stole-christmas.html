He started out doing impressionist work across Canada before moving to Los Angeles, where he eventually dropped impressions in favor of a more improvised act, fearing impressions were a dead-end road.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/dumb-and-dumber-to.jpg><p data-characters=287 data-current-count=287 data-injectable=false>During his early days in LA, he auditioned for shows like Saturday Night Live before landing roles in small films and becoming a cast member on In Living Color. This helped him land his breakout role in Ace Ventura: Pet Detective which led to star turns in The Mask and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dumb and Dumber</a>.</p><p data-characters=418 data-current-count=705 data-injectable=true>By the time How the Grinch Stole Christmas rolled around, Carrey was coming off a run of critically successful films like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Truman Show </a>and Man on the Moon, which showcased his range beyond comedy. For many of the young viewers tuning in to catch <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">his performance as the furry green holiday-hater</a>, this Christmas film was their introduction to Carrey although he had already built up a storied career by its release.</p><h2 id=h-how-old-was-jim-carrey-in-how-the-grinch-stole-christmas data-injectable=false>How old was Jim Carrey in How the Grinch Stole Christmas?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/how-the-grinch-stole-christmas.jpg><p data-characters=239 data-current-count=539 data-injectable=true>Carrey was 37 when he starred in How the Grinch Stole Christmas, and 38 when the film was released in Nov. 2000. He began his career in the 1980s with his impressionist comedy act before becoming a success in the mid-90s in his early 30s.</p><p data-characters=344 data-current-count=344 data-injectable=false>It’s hard to determine Carrey’s age in his thick Grinch makeup, which took hours of preparation (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a process Carrey likened to being “buried alive”</a>). The film’s producer, Brian Grazer, enlisted the help of a CIA specialist who helped Carrey learn techniques to “survive torture” in order to finish the film.</p><p data-characters=330 data-current-count=674 data-injectable=true>His experience on set likely informed <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Carrey’s decision not to return for a sequel</a>. Just last year, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Carrey shared he was considering retiring from acting</a> saying it would take a “script that’s written in gold ink that says to [him] it’s going to be really important for people to see” to get him back on set.</p><p>““And I feel like — and this is something you might never hear another celebrity say, for as long as time exists — I have enough. I’ve done enough, I am enough.”</p><p data-characters=174 data-current-count=358 data-injectable=false>Fair enough. We have to respect Carrey’s decision to step back from the spotlight but we can at least <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">watch his contribution to the Grinch movie canon</a> in the meantime!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJon6ivXaS5pXnWmqpmopmieqSt0aucsmWnnbKveceeZKyskae%2FprCMoqVmoJ%2BserW0xGaeq6GemLVuv9Ooo55lk52%2Fqr%2FTppisZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./darcey-silva-siblings-who-are-stacey-silva-and-michael-silva.html><span>←</span><span>Darcey Silva siblings: Who are Stacey Silva and Michael Silva</span></a>
