The show, a spooky mystery/horror/comedy based on The Addams Family produced and directed by gothic grandmaster Tim Burton is garnering favorable reviews from audiences and critics alike and huge kudos for its titular <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">lead performance by Jenna Ortega.</a> But some have noticed that despite taking place in a school for “outcasts” and marginalized folk there don’t seem to be many …or any, LGBTQ characters. Which is causing many to cry “queerbaiting!”</p>Recommended Videos<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Netflix and their queerbaiting need to die cause then what was the point of promoting the Wednesday show like this? I’m sick to my stomach rn <a href=#>#wednesdaynetflix</a> <a href=#>https://t.co/bvz2tiVQcs</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/vNiqfd0Qxw</a></p>— icy ♡’s luffy🏴‍☠️🍖 (@luffyslover) <a href=#>November 22, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=696 data-injectable=true>Just a few weeks prior to Wednesday‘s premiere, Netflix hosted a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom Hardy Mad Max bait meme</a> worth event named “WednesGay” featuring queer performers and drag queens. All well and good except that not one of the many attendees of the series’ fictional “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nevermore Academy</a>” or the population of the nearby township of Jericho, Vermont appears or reads as tangibly queer.</p><p data-characters=526 data-current-count=526 data-injectable=true>Wednesday and her roommate Enid — played by Emily Myers, who is arguably the breakout new star of the series — both have multiple love interests but all strictly heterosexual. This is certainly not in itself bait, but when the studio precedes it with a shout of “WednesGay!” and then excludes queer stories leaving LGBTQ viewers with little to do but hope someone gets clumsily “Dumbledored” out of the closet before any <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">future season</a>, then the current anger in the community is more than understandable.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>So, the marketing team for that new Wednesday Addams show on Netflix is taking a page from TNT and queerbaiting the crud out of its viewers, huh?</p>— Liv Moreno (@Adm_Hawthorne) <a href=#>November 28, 2022</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>netflix wednesday was queerbaiting i will stand by this</p>— val 🍃🍷 (@222valberry) <a href=#>November 25, 2022</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>I was always disagreeing w/ people saying Wednesday was queerbaiting, cause it genuinely wasn't. But this? Yeah this is kinda getting into queerbait territory now<br>Netflix knows most of their audience likes wenclair and they're gonna capitalise on that, regardless of the canon <a href=#>https://t.co/WkTR4TT7Bt</a></p>— ★ Clover ★ (@buttermintbee) <a href=#>November 28, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=673 data-injectable=true>Just this afternoon in yet another epic example of failing to read the room, the Netflix official Twitter posted a still of Wednesday and Enid in their room with the caption, “The opposites attract storyline we needed.” Yes, we know, “gal pals” and all that, but they may as well have had a gif of Tom hardy pointing above his head below the image.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>i haven't watched wednesday specifically BECAUSE the queerbaiting bothers me and yet i'm genuinely folding for wenclair just from the edits 😭😭 <a href=#>https://t.co/D7Z5SpxaMR</a></p>— ross 🍦🦇 (@scoops4hoy) <a href=#>November 28, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=465 data-current-count=765 data-injectable=false>And while it should be stated again that it is not incumbent on a filmmaker to include queer storylines by default, a studio shouldn’t take advantage of a marginalized population’s desire for representation to get them to watch a show (the ‘ships will happen without you, Netflix. Don’t worry about it). Next time throw the folks a bone if you’re going to “wink wink, nudge nudge” them. It’s what the real Wednesday would do.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e82eq5%2Bkma16pLvMoqWgZaWjsaa%2BjJ%2Bgq51dm7%2BwuYywnJ2mlaixosWMn5inq12kw6a%2BjJqjpZ2XmrFuvdSenKuakZ7BqrrGaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tony-rock-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Tony Rock Net Worth - Pulptastic</span></a>
