All I knew about the critter was that it looked cool, was a girl, and was purple. So Violet it was. It's not a brilliant name, but I have very fond memories of her.

I still think this is a pretty good name for a Water starter.</p><p>Oven the Fuecoco--it's a Fire starter with a big mouth that I want to put a pizza in. That's the only explanation. I do think it was a pretty good nickname for not knowing exactly what the evolution line was going to do, since being a crocodilian it would probably keep that big mouth regardless of what else changed.</p><p>Paxton the Smoliv--male name that contains "pax", Latin for peace, which olive branches symbolize. I'm just pleased I came up with something etymologically appropriate that was a bit more creative than Oliver.</p><p>Scarecrow the Rowlet--specifically my Rowlet in Legends: Arceus. I picked the nickname based on the silhouette of Hisuian Decidueye and was very happy that it did, in fact, end up looking like a scarecrow.</p><p>Lucky the Paras--from my file on the 3DS Virtual Console release of Pokémon Red. It was originally named...Portobello, I think, or some other type of mushroom. But I pulled it in to fight Misty when I was getting absolutely walloped by her Starmie and was expecting to lose. It landed a Stun Spore and paralyzed the Starmie. Every single move after that point either missed or was stopped by the paralysis kicking in, allowing my Paras to slowly whittle away the health bar and win the battle. Afterward, I changed its name to Lucky as soon as I could.</p><p>Xerox the Ditto--pretty much every Ditto I've ever caught has been nicknamed Xerox. I just think it's a good name for a Ditto.</p><p>(I have more, but this has already gotten long...)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHy4tMCtZKKrXa68tr6Mn5ivp6KewaZ5zaKapKaRorJuxc6uZKGZppp6qLXVnqVmrJ9irm68zqScpqeeY4BxfJVyamg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pottery-throwdown-keith-brymer-jones-wife-marj-hogarth-age-gap-wikipedia-213320-html.html><span>←</span><span>Pottery Throwdown Keith Brymer Jones Wife Marj Hogarth Age Gap &amp;amp; Wikipedia</span></a>
