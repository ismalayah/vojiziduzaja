Since embodying the Mother of Dragons herself, the British actress has played Terminator‘s Sarah Connor, Han Solo’s first love, and a Marvel alien with a diddy Dave Baustisa arm ⏤ but how much is she worth?</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=443 data-current-count=443 data-injectable=true>As the leading lady of perhaps the biggest TV show of the 2010s, you’d think it only appropriate that Clarke brought home a big, fat paycheck for each and every episode of GoT — and you would be right about that. For seasons 5 and 6, the 37-year-old star received a considerable $500,000 per episode. Multiply that by those two 10-part seasons, and that means Clarke earned $10 million from just one quarter of Thrones‘ runtime.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Emilia-Clarke-Giah-Secret-Invasion-1.jpg><p data-characters=573 data-current-count=873 data-injectable=true>For the HBO fantasy epic’s final runs, seasons 7 and 8, Clarke was awarded a significant pay-bump up to $1.1 million per episode, although with the reduced episode count, that means she only (!) accrued a further $14 million before the series concluded in 2019. Since then, gigs like earning a cool $750,000 for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel’s Secret Invasion</a> have only helped increase Clarke’s star power and bank balance. Although her two properties, one in California worth $4.64 million and one in Hampstead, London, priced at $8 million, probably put a dent in her savings.</p><p data-characters=428 data-current-count=428 data-injectable=false>All told, then, Emilia Clarke is believed to have a net worth of $20 million, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>. That’s nothing to sniff at, for sure, but also — to put it in perspective within the Hollywood hierarchy — it’s just a fifth of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">what Meryl Streep is worth</a>. Clarke is also only the third richest Game of Thrones star, behind joint winners Jason Momoa and Peter Dinklage, both worth $25 million apiece.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZZWitq21wGaapZmioLK0ec2eq2avn6fBqXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./streetwise-1985.html><span>←</span><span>Streetwise movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1985)</span></a>
