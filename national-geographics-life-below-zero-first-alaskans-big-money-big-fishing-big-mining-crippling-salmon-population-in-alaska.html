They take over to board of fish, they take over to politicians, they have them in their pocket and it becomes like a fish mafia out here.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/14141338_Life-Below-Zero-Ricko-Dewilde-img.jpg><h2 class="RxNC PvZ nIjP PMXY LmsH SfAH mNgy lNbo LBPR">Big Fishing</h2><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">DeWilde claims that international corporations have essentially taken over the Alaska Board of Fisheries, the key decision makers on who gets to fish when and where.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">“I wish more people would realize what’s going on with this fishing industry out here,” he said. “That demand that you see for Alaskan seafood is what’s crippling the river system out here. [Commercial fishers] are getting too much out on the ocean and they’re intercepting these fish before they even get to the river water. That’s impacting our way of life as far as native people out here.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/14152142_TheRisingTides-LifeBelowZero.jpg><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">“Big fishing,” as DeWilde puts it, is impacting the state’s vast ecosystem. Not just salmon.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">“You’re also seeing a huge crash in the crab,” he said. “There was [sic] billions of crab that just disappeared. It’s a terrible domino effect that I see coming in Alaska and it scares me and it’s sad to even have to talk about it.”</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">He went on to say, “Commercial fishing can’t just keep going on just because they make money. We’re a small percentage of taking of the fish and we’re prohibited from fishing completely.”</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">DeWilde says the companies are not fishing for salmon, but for native Alaskan Pollock fish or others popular in fast food fish sandwiches.</p><p><span class="gtOS vOCw EQwF ncwc Qmvg nyTI SRXV VbLm jgBf ystq CiUC kqbG akor ARhV ygKV Bbez UOtx CVfp xijV soGR XgdC aWMf daWq">Like a fish mafia out here.</span></p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Most salmon caught is a product of bycatch, catching another animal or fish fisherman do not want, cannot sell, or are not allowed to keep.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">“If there was a boycott on fast food fish sandwiches, we’d probably see a big impact on helping save the salmon,” he said. “Bycatch is what’s destroying [the salmon population].”</p><h2 class="RxNC PvZ nIjP PMXY LmsH SfAH mNgy lNbo LBPR">Big Mining</h2><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Ambler Road, a proposed 211-mile road to the Ambler Mining District in northwest Alaska, would cross the Koyukon, Tanana Athabascans and Iñupiat native lands, according to the Associated Press.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Natives say this will directly impact the ecosystem in the area, directly impacting the salmon population.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">“They dig into streams, those are salmon-spawning streams,” DeWilde said. “They go all the way up these rivers, thousands of miles, just to lay their eggs in this fresh water.”</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Public comments on the project will be accepted up until Dec. 22. A public hearing on the project will begin at 5 p.m. local time on Dec. 13. DeWilde hopes the project can still be stopped if enough people raise concerns.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">“I’m hoping more people chime in,” he said. “The only way to stop big money is big numbers of people.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/14152140_HowWeSurvive-FirstAlaskans.jpg><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">With frigid weather as an added obstacle, native Alaskans are scared by this clear threat of big business on native land.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">“I’m freaked out by big money,” DeWilde said. “Big money, big mining, big fishing is the big threat to our natural, wild way of life here in Alaska.”</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">You can learn more about Alaska’s salmon problem and how native Alaskans live on a new season of “Life Below Zero: First Alaskans.” New episodes are available on National Geographic and previous seasons are streaming now on Disney+ and Hulu.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv"><i>Disney is the parent company of National Geographic, Hulu, Disney+ and this station.</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnnpbBqrvNmqNmn5WktLOtz6GgnKtdobansYybnKWnp2LHpr7OZp2iqqOpeqK4wKyimqajYq%2Bqs4ympqedqWKvqrOMn6CsoJmjtG6uyKBkpqGenruoecKroKmonJ67qHnSmqOmp55ivbC81KWYraGfo3qquoyao5qrm5Z8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-early-should-you-get-to-your-deer-stand.html><span>←</span><span>How early should you get to your deer stand?</span></a>
