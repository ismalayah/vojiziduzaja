Friedkin sadly passed away at the age of 87 yesterday after 60 years of working in Hollywood.</p><p data-characters=289 data-current-count=538 data-injectable=true>One man heavily influenced by Friedkin is none other than Guillermo Del Toro, who’s directed numerous spooky classics such as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pan’s Labyrinth</a> and the two good <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hellboy</a> films. Del Toro shared a heartfelt tweet clearly showing that the director’s death had affected him emotionally.</p><p>“Im not typing well. Fat fingers and feeling distraught.”</p><p data-characters=408 data-current-count=472 data-injectable=true>Clearly the death of Friedkin has hit Del Toro pretty hard, although he still managed to inject some self-deprecating humor into his tweet. His comment refers to a story about Friedkin that Del Toro <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">shared on Twitter</a> which contained a few typos. Although it’s a pretty heartwarming personal experience that he had with the legendary director so most fans probably weren’t even concerned about the errors.</p><p>“I had seen, at the ripe age of 58, that of th[e] many tools in Billy’s arsenal, kindness was one of the most effective ones.”</p><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=459 data-injectable=true>William Friedkin was known for having little patience which could put some actors on edge, however, the story shows how he could also be understanding and kind: “here we had a master – one loves by cast and crew, knowingly and wisely turning a checkmate into a victory solely with gentle empathy: he knew.”</p><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=217 data-injectable=false>Del Toro’s Twitter page has pretty much become a shrine to the late director since the news of his death was announced. He also posted a picture of himself on set with Friedkin <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">right after news of his passing broke</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=517 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>The world has lost one of the Gods of Cinema. Cinema has lost a true Scholar and I have lost a dear, loyal and true friend. William Friedkin has left us.

Thank you for being you”</p><p>“Do not be downhearted, your Monster Action Models will need some attention soon. Your Friend will always be loved in your many memories. We love you, too.”</p><p>“It’s been a hard few weeks for the art world. Stay strong, amigo.”</p><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=396 data-injectable=false>It seems that the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pinocchio</a> director knew Friedkin better than most, he clearly had a great admiration for him and it shows in how Del Toro has chosen to celebrate the man’s life on his Twitter. He left a massive legacy behind and directors like Del Toro continue to carry the torch for future generations to come.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJonZqsXZu2r7PEq6pmmZ6ZeqexxKWgp59dmba0wNGarKCgpGK0trXLpZyrpZ9isaa4jK2mq6ddnba1eceaqZ1lkq56tbTEZqeaq6Oeu6h5zp9kraCVYrK5u9GcoKysXZm2s7HCraarZaeeua21wKZkn6qZmrGstc1o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chii-wvttz-death-cause-was-the-bronx-rapper-shot-to-death-real-name-revealed.html><span>←</span><span>Chii Wvttz Death Cause: Was The Bronx Rapper Shot To Death?
