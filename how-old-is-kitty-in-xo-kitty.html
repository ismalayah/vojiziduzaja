If you feel like more time has passed in between the last movie and XO, Kitty, you’d be right.</p><h2 id=h-kitty-s-age-in-xo-kitty data-injectable=false>Kitty’s age in XO, Kitty</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=586 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=530 data-current-count=530 data-injectable=true>In the show, about four years have passed since the events of the last movie. Per Netflix, Kitty is now 16 years old (Cathcart, who was born in 2003, is 19) and excited to go on her own adventure this time around. Although we last saw her as a middle school student, Kitty is now a junior in high school, the same age her mother was when she studied abroad at KISS on an international scholarship. After convincing her parents, Kitty is now headed abroad on the same scholarship to learn more about her mother, love, and herself.</p><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=265 data-injectable=false>The newest trailer shows things will not be as easy as Kitty as convinced herself as it appears her long-distance love has an in-person girlfriend. Luckily, we’ll find out the first season of XO, Kitty plays out on May 18, when Netflix drops all 10 episodes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ypu9ZmpqWcXZ7AbrfIrauyZZmjerm7jKSgraypZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./love-is-blind-gold-metal-wine-glasses.html><span>←</span><span>Whats the deal with those weird gold metal wine glasses on Love is Blind?</span></a>
