Indeed, the same workshop that brought the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to life for their first live-action movie in 1990 worked on FNaF, Jim Henson’s Creature Shop.</p><p data-characters=259 data-current-count=259 data-injectable=false>Project supervisor and lead designer Robert Bennett even took the time to respond to an unsubstantiated comment on the FNaF trailer on YouTube accusing the movie of using CGI instead of making real animatronics. As he explained to SFX Magazine (via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MovieWeb</a>):</p><p>“Well, no, it was all our costumes. Everything in that trailer is our costumes and nothing was touched up with digital.”</p><p data-characters=494 data-current-count=888 data-injectable=true>The process for bringing the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">animatronics to life</a> was incredibly complex and involved puppeteers being “directly on the puppets, making it move,” in some instances and operating remote controls off-screen in other cases, as director Emma Tammi explained in an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">io9</a>. With that said, Tammi did say there was some post-production digital clean-up to the images done here or there, a common practice for any film nowadays let alone one with animatronics. As she explained:</p><p>“The whole approach of this movie and certainly with the animatronics was to do everything practically. There still ends up being a fantastic collaboration to be had with VFX artists, whether that be clean-up or enhancements. And all of our conversations with the VFX teams were also about how can we support it feeling looking practical. So we were really all in sync about that, which was an exciting collaboration.”</p><p data-characters=74 data-current-count=74 data-injectable=false>Five Nights at Freddy’s comes to theaters and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Peacock</a> on October 27.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomKudXam1pnnAp6CmmaSnvK%2B1wqxknJ%2BZYravedOhnGaemauybrrIoJ%2Btq12WwW6y0Z6bnbGjYrqwwsieZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-survivor-46-star-q-burdettes-survivor-hot-take.html><span>←</span><span>What is Survivor 46 star Q Burdettes Survivor hot take?</span></a>
