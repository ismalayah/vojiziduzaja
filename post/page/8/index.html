Usually 15 minutes before shooting light if it is really cold. 30 minutes before shooting if not. Some stands I wait until I can see (especially during the rut) before I slip into them. Usually 30-60 minutes before shooting light but occassionally I'll wait til after it gets light out so I don't scare deer off a field. &nbsp;Takedown request View complete answer on forums.bowsite.com How early should you be in deer stand?</article><article class=post-entry><h2>National Geographic's 'Life Below Zero: First Alaskans': Big money, big fishing, big mining cripplin</h2><time>Aug 29, 2024</time>

There is no more salmon. That’s what native Alaskan Ricko DeWilde is most concerned with these days. The cast member and segment producer on National Geographic’s, “Life Below Zero: First Alaskans,” spoke with us about what he describes as an untenable living situation.
Once flowing with abundance, native tribes have been sounding the alarm about the overfishing of Alaskan salmon and other native fish by international fishing companies, essentially wiping out natives’ main source of food as well as a cultural touchstone.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Hateful Eight movie review (2015)</h2><time>Aug 29, 2024</time>

By my stopwatch, four-fifths of "The Hateful Eight" takes place indoors, first in the stagecoach traveling to Minnie's, then in the cabin and a nearby barn. Tarantino asked his regular cinematographer, Robert Richardson, to shoot in Ultra Panavision 70mm, a format that has barely been used since the "road show" epics of the 1960s, and built an overture and an intermission into his already extravagant running time, yet he's staged most of the film's action away from direct sunlight.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead: Unexpected hiatus for episode 10 and beyond, explained</h2><time>Aug 29, 2024</time>

More than a week has passed since Bug Films announced&nbsp;Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead&nbsp;is on an indefinite hiatus, and still, there’s no update on when episodes 10 through 12 will air. Despite frustrating delays, the new anime has gained quite the fandom since it first aired in July. Interest may dwindle, however, if this hiatus lasts too long, especially with the fall’s exciting anime lineup.
